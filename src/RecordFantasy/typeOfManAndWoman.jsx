                        <p className="text-lg"> <span className="font-bold"> Qualities: </span> Self Confident, Outgoing & Enterprising</p>
                        <p className='mt-2'>
                            The alpha male personality type goes with the alias 'bad boy' and alpha males are usually the men who need their men to be men! He's the macho guy,
                            who exudes confidence with a tad bit of aggression, who is outgoing and demanding and definitely very sexist! That in no way means he objectifies women, but he knows for a fact he can get any woman he wishes to.
                            And mostly, he wishes for someone a lot more docile and with a few or no alpha features.
                            He's a little tough to work with because his ego skyrockets anytime he's proven wrong. But he makes up for that through his charming personality.
                            Women will get no comfort or support from an alpha male and if a woman does cheat on her partner she will cheat with an alpha male.

                    <p className='text-2xl text-start mb-3'> (2) Beta Male Personality </p>
                    <p className="text-lg"> <span className="font-bold"> Qualities: </span> Collaborative & Introvert</p>
                    <p className='mt-2'>
                        Your average 'Mr. nice guy' is the perfect beta male. He's quite moderate in his approach to life and his nice guy personality gets him by.
                        He gets taken for a ride, every now and then because of that, but generally, he's quite likeable.
                        They're definitely more sensitive and less aggressive than an alpha male and a lot more grounded.
                        They take criticism well and show better collaborative skills.
                        The one thing that can intrude their stellar performance as a man is their reserved nature and introvert-like behaviour.
                        They're the guys who were really quiet while in school and a bit nerdy too and were probably bullied about a little.
                        They just grew up to be light-hearted, emotional nice guys, who are also a bit idealistic!
                        Women usually prefer beta males to alpha for a life partner, especially if an alpha has broken her heart.
                        Obviously, she'll go for the nice guy, who won't break her heart. Although, women prefer beta males as friends more than lovers.
                        Yup, beta males make for some excellent friends for the opposite sex!

                    <p className="text-lg"> <span className="font-bold"> Qualities: </span>  Eccentric, Kinda Nerdy & Laid Back</p>
                    <p className='mt-2'>
                        So, every Ben Stiller movie you've seen, there's a great example of an Omega male. He has really nerdy habits. Like he may be a collector of something like coins, comic books, insects or even video games. He's highly laid back and lazy and acts like he hasn't a care in the world.
                        He's immature to an extent, irresponsible and definitely lacks ambition. He was also picked a lot in school or college because of his aloof behaviour most times. Omegas are also said to be highly intelligent beings but they don't really act on that. They lack enough ambition to do something about their intelligence. They can solve a complicated math problem while eating a pizza and couldn't give a damn about anything else.
                        They make for lazy husbands who rely on their wife's expenses most times and don't lift a finger to help her with house chores. I know you're silently sitting there and reading this, thinking, 'damn, that's me'.

                    <p className="text-lg"> <span className="font-bold"> Qualities: </span> Adventurous, Fun-Loving & Restless </p>
                    <p className='mt-2'>
                        Gamma males love having fun but don't shrug off their responsibilities at the same time. They're definitely adventurous and fun-loving and tend to get very restless if they're left idle for too long. It is possible an alpha male might mature into a gamma male, because gamma males are a more refined version of them.
                        They're sensitive towards the opposite sex and are very aware of the needs and nature of what women truly want and they do anything in their power to fulfil their partner's needs. Yup, women are lucky to have a gamma male in their life.
                        They also display a certain amount of feminine behaviours, expectations and values to win their partners heart. They love putting their family first, in any given situation and scenario.

                    <p className="text-lg"> <span className="font-bold"> Qualities: </span> Aloof, Resentful & Private </p>
                    <p className='mt-2'>
                        Delta males haven't been faring well in the game of life. They were once alphas or even gammas but probably a tragedy struck hard at some point, and they quietly resigned to their fate and withdrew completely.
                        Extremely private people, deltas are aloof, with an 'I really couldn't care less' attitude and are often resentful towards something or the other. They're not very welcome at social gatherings due to these reasons and are often lonely.
                        A Delta male will attract someone with similar characteristics became if they don't, their partner who might be a gamma, alpha or a beta, will find them extremely boring and dull, unless of course, they change their lifestyle around.
