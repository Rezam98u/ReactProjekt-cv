In the provided code, there is a potential bug in the CSS code. The issue is with the selector `.cursor_Hover:hover .cursor`. 

The problem is that it assumes there is an HTML element with the class "cursor" nested inside the element with the class "cursor_Hover". However, there is no guarantee that such an element with the "cursor" class exists as a child of `.cursor_Hover`.

To fix this bug, ensure that the HTML structure matches the CSS selector. Alternatively, you can modify the CSS selector to accommodate different HTML structures. For example, you can use a more general selector like `.cursor_Hover:hover .cursor` to target any descendant with the class "cursor" inside any element with the class "cursor_Hover".
